	<h3>What even is "THE SVELTE UI FRAMEWORK" and why you should give it a try.</h3>

	<p>
		A library of components made with Svelte... this site is where I collect those snippets so you
		can browse them, click through examples, and copy the code to use in your projects. I built this
		as a tiny UI framework to speed up development, and also to learn Svelte lol. It's a Hack Club
		Siege project!
